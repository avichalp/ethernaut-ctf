## Ethernaut CTFs

This repo contains solutions to [ethernaut CTF](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) puzzles. Puzzles have faulty Solidity-based smart contracts. The goal of each exercise is to exploit the vulnerability.

This repo uses hardhat, a JS-based Dapp framework with Clojurescript code snippets to exploit the contracts.
